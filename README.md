This project is an interactive grid-based simulation system for pathfinding and multi-agent shape formation. It serves as an educational and research tool for exploring various pathfinding algorithms and coordination strategies for multiple agents.

Project Summary
The simulator allows users to:

Visualize and compare different pathfinding algorithms:
Classical algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS)
Game theory algorithms (Minimax, Alpha-Beta, Expectimax)
Experiment with multi-agent coordination:
Sequential movement (one agent at a time)
Parallel movement (all agents move simultaneously)
F1 safety car queue (decentralized coordination)
Create and form shapes:
Predefined shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles)
Custom shapes by selecting cells on the grid
Automated shape formation with multiple agents
Integrate advanced AI techniques:
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for decentralized path planning
Genetic Algorithms (GA) for optimizing paths
Training interfaces for both MARL and GA approaches
The project includes comprehensive visualization tools, performance metrics, and an AI assistant to help users understand the algorithms and features. It's designed to be both educational for understanding pathfinding concepts and practical for experimenting with multi-agent coordination strategies.

The system is implemented in Python using tkinter for the GUI, with TensorFlow integration for the MARL components, making it accessible for educational purposes while still providing advanced capabilities for research.
